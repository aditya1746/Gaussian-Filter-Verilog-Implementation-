# Gaussian-Filter-Verilog-Implementation-

In this project we used Verilog hardware description language, to form a gaussian filter for removing noise from images.

Verilog was chosen, to ensure the scalability of the project, i.e... to process images in real time using a FPGA.

For running the codes on your system, refer to slides 6 & 7 of the ppt.
